# Personal Budget Dashboard - BudgetView

## 🧠 About

Hi! I'm Utku, and this project is part of my personal portfolio.  
I built **BudgetView** to practice and showcase my skills in modern React development, data visualization, and UI design.  
While it’s not a production app, I’ve focused on clean structure, responsiveness, and interactive elements that simulate real-world scenarios.

Feedback and ideas are always welcome!
